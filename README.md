Exploratory Graphs

Goal: Examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 

Task: Reconstruct the given plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

Data:	Individual household electric power consumption Data Set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The variables in the dataset are:
1.	Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2.	Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3.	Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4.	Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5.	Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6.	Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7.	Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8.	Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
9.	Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Detailed Steps:
Fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

For each plot:
* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When finished, push the git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.

The four plots to construct are shown below. 

### Plot 1

### Plot 2

### Plot 3

### Plot 4
